Gold Economic Impact Analysis

Event Study on the Impact of Macroeconomic News on Gold Prices

**Overview**

This project investigates how major macroeconomic announcements affect gold price returns.
Using an Event Study methodology, the analysis measures market reactions before, during, and after key economic events such as CPI, FOMC, and NFP.

Gold is widely considered a safe-haven asset, and understanding its behavior around economic news is crucial for investors, analysts, and policymakers.

**Objectives**

Analyze the reaction of gold prices to major economic announcements

Measure average returns before, on, and after event dates

Compare the impact of different types of macroeconomic events

Demonstrate practical data analysis and financial research skills using Python

**Data Description**
Gold Price Data
Daily gold price data
Calculated daily returns based on closing prices
Time-indexed for accurate event alignment

Economic Events Data
Event dates of major macroeconomic announcements
Event categories (e.g., CPI, FOMC, NFP)

**Methodology**
Event Study Framework
For each economic event, an event window of 11 trading days is defined:
5 days before the event
Event day
5 days after the event
Daily returns are analyzed within this window to capture short-term market reactions.

Analysis Steps
Data loading and preprocessing
Daily return calculation
Event window extraction
Aggregation of returns by event type
Visualization and summary table generation

**Results**
The analysis shows that gold price reactions differ across event types:
Some events trigger immediate market reactions on the announcement day
In certain cases, price movements occur before the official release, suggesting market anticipation
Post-event effects indicate that some announcements have lingering impacts
These findings align with financial theories related to market expectations and partial market efficiency.

**Tools & Technologies**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
